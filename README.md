# CreditCardFraudRnD: Hybrid GenAI Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This repository contains a state-of-the-art, real-time fraud detection engine designed for modern fintech environments. It implements a hybrid architecture combining unsupervised deep learning, adversarial generation, and continuous streaming machine learning to protect against sophisticated fraud vectors like synthetic identities, VPN-based anomalies, and velocity attacks.

The system is built based on the research principles of sub-second inference, explainable AI (XAI), and a robust, automated risk-tiering methodology to ensure regulatory compliance and operational precision.

## 🚦 3-Tier Risk Decision Engine
Aligned with the core research proposal, the inference engine maps the VAE-GAT reconstruction thresholds and ensemble probabilities into three distinct operational tiers:

- **Tier 1: Critical Risk [🚨 Auto-Decline]**
  - **Condition:** Ensemble Probability > 40% OR VAE Anomaly > 40% (Normative p95 breach).
  - **Action:** Transaction instantly declined. Flags standard fraud, synthetic identities, velocity attacks, and VPN anomalies.
- **Tier 2: Moderate Risk / High Value [📞 Bank Verification Required]**
  - **Condition:** Risk Score between 15% and 40% **OR** Transaction Amount > $5,000.
  - **Action:** Transaction suspended pending manual cardholder verification call, preventing large fund extraction.
- **Tier 3: Normal Behavior [✅ Auto-Approve]**
  - **Condition:** Baseline baseline Risk Score < 15% and Amount < $5,000.
  - **Action:** Seamlessly approved to ensure low false-positive friction.

### 1. Hybrid Intelligence Engine
- **Generative Anomaly Modeling (VAE-GAT)**: A Variational Autoencoder equipped with a PyTorch Multihead Attention layer learns the latent distribution of legitimate transactions while simultaneously capturing relational dynamics in the mini-batch (Graph Attention). It flags anomalies based on reconstruction error.
- **Adversarial Synthesis (WGAN-GP)**: A Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty synthesizes 5,000 highly realistic synthetic fraud transactions, balancing the dataset before training the ensemble.
- **Continuous Learning Ensemble**: Utilizing a streaming SGD-based classifier (Scikit-Learn) that adapts to **Concept Drift** in real-time. Unlike traditional batch models, this system learns incrementally.

### 2. Explainable AI (XAI)
- **SHAP Integration**: Every decision is accompanied by a feature importance breakdown. The system explains *why* a transaction was flagged (e.g., due to IP Address risk or high Velocity), ensuring transparency for risk officers.

### 3. Real-Time Dashboard
- **White Glassmorphism UI**: A professional, enterprise-grade dashboard provided via FastAPI and Vanilla JS.
- **Live Monitoring**: Visualizes risk scores, VAE reconstruction errors, and continuous learning ROC-AUC metrics.
