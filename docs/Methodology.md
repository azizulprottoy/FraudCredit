# Research Methodology

## 3.1 Research Philosophy and Design
This study employs a **Design Science Research (DSR)** methodology, which prioritizes the creation and evaluation of artificial artifacts to solve identified real-world problems. The objective is to develop a functional, high-accuracy fintech fraud detection framework. The research design integrates a **Pragmatic Approach**, focusing on empirical validation via quantitative performance metrics and real-time operational feasibility.

The framework adheres to three core design principles:
1. **Real-time Feasibility**: Ensuring sub-millisecond inference latency for frictionless authorization.
2. **Proactive Resilience**: Using generative modeling to anticipate "zero-day" fraud vectors before they manifest in historical logs.
3. **Explainability (XAI)**: Providing transparent, feature-level insights for regulatory compliance and auditability.

## 3.2 Data Selection and Environment
The research leverages the **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset** (sourced from Vesta Corporation via Kaggle). This dataset is chosen for its high dimensionality (400+ features) and realistic representation of complex digital payment behavior.

| Property | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Source** | IEEE-CIS / Vesta Corporation |
| **Observations** | ~590,000 Transactions (joined with Identity metadata) |
| **Class Imbalance** | ~3.5% Fraud Prevalence (Minority Class) |
| **Complexity** | Sparse categorical variables, heavy missing values, extreme dimensionality |

## 3.3 Data Preprocessing Pipeline
To transform raw multi-modal payment data into ML-ready tensors, a modular five-stage pipeline was implemented:

1. **Deterministic Merging**: Relational join between transaction and identity databases using a unique `TransactionID` key.
2. **Stratified Sampling**: A 10% stratified sample was utilized for local training efficiency while preserving the critical 3.5% fraud distribution.
3. **Missing Value Management**: Sentinel imputation (`-999`) was applied to numerical features, while categorical nulls were treated as an explicit "missing" class to preserve structural information.
4. **Categorical Encoding**: High-cardinality nominal features were transformed via **Label Encoding** to enable tensor compatibility.
5. **Feature Standardization**: Global feature scaling was applied via **StandardScaler** to ensure uniform gradient propagation across deep learning layers.

## 3.4 Hybrid Generative Framework Architecture
The core architectural contribution is a multi-stage hybrid engine that synthesizes generative modeling with continuous learning.

### 3.4.1 Unsupervised Anomaly Modeling (VAE-GAT Hybrid)
The **Variational Autoencoder with Graph Attention (VAE-GAT)** is utilized for its ability to model complex, high-dimensional probability distributions of legitimate transaction data, while capturing relationship dependencies. The architecture consists of:
- **Encoder Network + Graph Attention ($q_\phi(z|x)$)**: A multi-layer perceptron compresses the input feature vector. To implement Graph Attention within computational constraints, an optimized PyTorch **MultiheadAttention** layer treats the mini-batch as a densely connected graph sequence. This allows the model to find relational associations between incoming transactions locally before mapping them into the latent space (to mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$).
- **Reparameterization Trick**: To enable backpropagation through stochastic layers, the latent variable $z$ is sampled as $z = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
- **Decoder Network ($p_\theta(x|z)$)**: A symmetric network that attempts to reconstruct the original transaction features from the latent $z$.
- **Loss Function**: The model is optimized using the **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**, combining:
  1. **Reconstruction Loss**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the input $x$ and reconstruction $x'$, measuring how well the model understands "normal" patterns.
  2. **KL Divergence**: Regularizes the latent space toward a standard Gaussian distribution, preventing overfitting to specific transaction identities.

Transactions with high reconstruction error are flagged as anomalies, as they represent behaviors that the VAE-GAT cannot "explain".

### 3.4.2 Adversarial Synthetic Data Generation (WGAN-GP)
To address the critical "Card-Not-Present" (CNP) fraud data scarcity, a **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)** is employed. Unlike standard GANs which suffer from mode collapse, WGAN-GP provides a more stable training signal:
- **Generator ($G$)**: Learns to map random noise and conditional attack labels (e.g., "VPN Anomaly") to realistic transaction feature vectors.
- **Critic ($D$)**: Unlike a traditional discriminator, the Critic outputs a scalar value representing the "realness" or quality of the sample. It is trained to estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between the real and synthetic distributions.
- **Gradient Penalty ($\lambda_{gp}$)**: A 1-Lipschitz continuity constraint is enforced via a gradient penalty on the Critic's norm. This ensures that the gradient doesn't vanish or explode, which is vital when synthesizing high-dimensional tabular data like the IEEE-CIS features.

The resulting WGAN-GP is operationally executed to generate **5,000 synthetic fraud samples**. These samples are actively concatenated back into the generic training loop, effectively augmenting and balancing the rare minority class before supervised learning begins.

### 3.4.3 Continuous Learning Ensemble (Streaming SGD)
Acknowledging that fraud patterns are non-stationary (**Concept Drift**), a **Streaming Ensemble** is implemented to provide "Online Learning":
- **Incremental Training**: Utilizing an **SGDClassifier** (Stochastic Gradient Descent) from Scikit-Learn utilizing a logarithmic loss, the model is built for incremental learning. 
- **Feedback Loop**: When a transaction is finalized, the model performs a partial fit (`fit_one`). This allows the system's decision boundary to shift in real-time, adapting to a new attack IP or device fingerprint within seconds.
- **Ensemble Fusion**: The final risk score is a fusion of the VAE-GAT anomaly score (unsupervised) and the Streaming Learner's probability.

## 3.5 Explainability and Decision Engine
Integration of **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** ensures that every fraud score is decomposes into individual feature contributions. The decision engine employs a tiered risk threshold:
- **Critical (Risk > 85%)**: Automated high-velocity block with "Fraud" reason code.
- **Moderate (40-85%)**: Flagged for adaptive friction (e.g., 2FA or analyst review).
- **Normal (Risk < 15%)**: Immediate authorization.

## 3.6 Evaluation Metrics
Performance is measured through a recall-prioritized lens, recognizing the asymmetric cost of fraud:
- **Recall (Detection Rate)**: The primary metric, maximizing the capture of fraudulent transactions.
- **Precision**: Minimizing false positives to prevent legitimate customer friction.
- **AUC-ROC**: Evaluation of discriminative power across varying risk thresholds.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean utilized for final model benchmarks.
